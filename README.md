# TranBrian10.github.io

v1.0

This version was built to test the aesthetics of an extremely minimal website design in the style of a business card, so it contains only a few important links and lines of text. Due to the site's simple nature, it was built with pure HTML and CSS, with a bit of JS for analytics.
